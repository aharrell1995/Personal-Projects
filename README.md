# Forecasting Transformer Invenotry Needs Project
This project is an exercise with Python, in which I used a dataset of Transformer Orders to forecast the lead times of transformers. I extracted, cleaned and loaded the data into an ARIMA model and generated predictions based on historical purchasing patterns. Modules used include:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Datetime
- Statsmodels
- Scikit Learn
